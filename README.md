# neural_net
A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that is modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. It is a network of interconnected nodes, called neurons, that process information and make predictions based on input data.

Neural networks can be used for a wide range of applications, including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. They can also be used for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering.

The shadow_2 uses for np.gradient(params,loss,axis=0) for updating the weights via backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent
